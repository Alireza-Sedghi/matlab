% DESCRIPTION
%
% 'region_percOverlap' returns the percentage overlap between two
% rectangular regions specified by the passed corner point vectors.
% The overlap is returned as a percentage of the smaller area of the
% two rectangles.
%
% The 'trick' with this function is catering for all the possible
% left/right top/bottom overlaps, as well as just-touching conditions
% and importantly, one box completely contained within another.
%
% The corner coordinates are interpreted as 
%
%       v_Rn    = [xn1, yn1, xn2, yn2]
%
% and are taken to be defined as:
%

% PRECONDITIONS
%       o v_R1 and v_R2 should be 4 element vectors
%
% POSTCONDITIONS
%       o af_perc is a percentage (of the smaller region)
%         overlap.
%       o If there is no overlap, af_perc is zero.
%
% HISTORY
% 12-Nov-2010
% o Initial design and coding.
